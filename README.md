# Git Usage ReadMe

## Introduction

Welcome to our project! This ReadMe file provides essential information about version control, Git, and alternatives, as well as some common Git commands.

## Version Control

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time. It allows you to track modifications, revert to previous stages, and work collaboratively with others. This helps in maintaining a structured and organized development process.

## Git vs. GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your codebase. GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform that provides hosting for Git repositories, facilitating collaboration and integration. While Git is the tool, GitHub is a service built around it.
